# jc

## Description

**jc** is a simple tool to compress JSON.  jc does no input validation.  jc reads from stdin and writes to stdout.

jc is built in [Go](https://golang.org/). jc does not use the [encoding/json](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json) package in the Go standard library, but simply iterates through the input characters.

jc is a memory efficient alternative to `jq -c .` since it does not buffer output longer than absolutely necessary.  However, jc does no validation of the input.

## Usage

Use `jc --version` to show the current version.

Below is the usage for the `jc` command.

```text

Usage:
  jc [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for jc
  -v, --version   show version
```

## Examples

Below is a trivial example.

```shell
$ echo '[{"a":  "b", "c": 1  }]' | bin/jc
[{"a":"b","c":1}]
```

## Building

**jc** is written in pure Go, so the only dependency needed to compile the server is [Go](https://golang.org/).  Go can be downloaded from <https://golang.org/dl/>.

This project uses [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage environment variables and automatically adding the `bin` and `scripts` folder to the path.  Install direnv and hook it into your shell.  The use of `direnv` is optional as you can always call jc directly with `bin/jc`.

If using `macOS`, follow the `macOS` instructions below.

To build a binary for your local operating system you can use `make bin/jc`.  To build for a release, you can use `make build_release`.  Additionally, you can call `go build` directly to support specific use cases.

### macOS

You can install `go` on macOS using homebrew with `brew install go`.

To install `direnv` on `macOS` use `brew install direnv`.  If using bash, then add `eval \"$(direnv hook bash)\"` to the `~/.bash_profile` file .  If using zsh, then add `eval \"$(direnv hook zsh)\"` to the `~/.zshrc` file.

## Testing

**CLI**

To run CLI testes use `make test_cli`, which uses [shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2).  If you recive a `shunit2:FATAL Please declare TMPDIR with path on partition with exec permission.` error, you can modify the `TMPDIR` environment variable in line or with `export TMPDIR=<YOUR TEMP DIRECTORY HERE>`. For example:

```shell
TMPDIR="/usr/local/tmp" make test_cli
```

**Go**

To run Go tests use `make test_go` (or `bash scripts/test.sh`), which runs unit tests, `go vet`, `go vet with shadow`, [errcheck](https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck), [staticcheck](https://staticcheck.io/), and [misspell](https://github.com/client9/misspell).
